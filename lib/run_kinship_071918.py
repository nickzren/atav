Take a KING kinship file, PED/FAM/sample file (for getting phenotype),
and optional coverage summary file in order to generate a list of samples
to remove iteratively as follows:
    1. remove affected that is related to the most other affecteds
        a. break ties by removing the affected distantly related to
            the most other affecteds 
        b. break ties by removing the affected related to the most unaffecteds
        c. break ties by removing the affected distantly related
            to the most unaffecteds
        d. (optional) break ties by removing the affected with the least
            coverage
    2. remove unaffected that is related to the most other unaffecteds
        a. break ties by removing the unaffected that is related to the most
            affecteds
        b. break ties by removing the unaffected that is distantly related to
            the most affecteds
        c. break ties by removing the unaffected that is distantly related to
            the most unaffecteds
        d. (optional) break ties by removing the unaffected with the least
            coverage
    3. remove unaffected that is related the most affecteds
        a. break ties by removing the unaffected that is distantly related to
            the most affecteds
        b. break ties by removing the unaffected that is distantly related to
            the most unaffecteds
        c. (optional) break ties by removing the unaffected with the least
            coverage

KING should be run like: king -b <bed_infile> --kinship --related --degree 3
